MODULES:
1. Playwright & playwright-stealth
To effectively retrieve the required data from the target website which serve web html pages from the server,  I decided to use a headless browser API mechanism for its ability to execute JavaScript and fully render web pages.
I chose Playwright  for this purpose because of its robust and stable toolkit, which supports a wide range of browser clients (including Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit - this came in handy for dynamic user-agent switching).
Its advanced features, such as automatic handling of waiting for elements and comprehensive API, facilitate efficient and reliable data extraction from web pages.

2. BeautifulSoup (bs4)
For tasks involving the extraction of data from static web pages or well-structured HTML documents, Beautiful Soup was my top choice. Unlike more complex web scraping technologies that handle JavaScript rendering, Beautiful Soup excels in simplicity
given its ease of use when dealing with straightforward HTML parsing. Its intuitive API allows for quick extraction and navigation of
HTML elements, which made it an ideal choice for the projects. Playwrite its self could do the job and simplicity was with Bs4

3. Regexp:
A lot of data was available in HTML elements but given the DOM state and TimeoutErrors, sometimes, data maybe be missed which is why, suplimenting
collected data with alternative sets picked up with regExpressions was a good choice

4. Pytest
For testing pytest was my choice for testing due to its ease of use.

5. boto3,botocore and s3transfer
For cloud storage I decided to go with AWS S3 storage offering due to its simplicity and robustness.

6.  Its possible to enrich the collected data using reverse geo search with Nominatim
 for datasets with coordinates - (optional)
